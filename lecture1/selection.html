            The Eatwell Guide shows that to have a healthy, balanced diet, people should try to:
            eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day (see 5 A Day)
            base meals on higher fibre starchy foods like potatoes, bread, rice or pasta
            have some dairy or dairy alternatives (such as soya drinks)
            eat some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other protein
            choose unsaturated oils and spreads, and eat them in small amounts
            drink plenty of fluids (at least 6 to 8 glasses a day)
            If you're having foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt and sugar, have these less often and in small amounts.
