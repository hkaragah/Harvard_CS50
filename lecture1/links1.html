        <h2 id="section1">Food groups in your diet</h2>
        <p>
            The Eatwell Guide shows that to have a healthy, balanced diet, people should try to:

            eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day (see 5 A Day)
            base meals on higher fibre starchy foods like potatoes, bread, rice or pasta
            have some dairy or dairy alternatives (such as soya drinks)
            eat some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other protein
            choose unsaturated oils and spreads, and eat them in small amounts
            drink plenty of fluids (at least 6 to 8 glasses a day)
            If you're having foods and drinks that are high in fat, salt and sugar, have these less often and in small amounts.

            Try to choose a variety of different foods from the 5 main food groups to get a wide range of nutrients.

            Most people in the UK eat and drink too many calories, too much saturated fat, sugar and salt, and not enough fruit, vegetables, oily fish or fibre.

            The Eatwell Guide does not apply to children under the age of 2 because they have different nutritional needs.

            After the age of 2 years, children should move to eating the same foods as the rest of the family in the proportions shown in the Eatwell Guide.

        <h2 id="section2">Fruit and vegetables: are you getting your 5 A Day?</h2>
        <p>
            Fruit and vegetables are a good source of vitamins and minerals and fibre, and should make up just over a third of the food you eat each day.

            It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.

            There's evidence that people who eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and some cancers.

            Eating 5 portions is not as hard as it sounds.

            A portion is:

            80g of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables
            30g of dried fruit – which should be kept to mealtimes
            150ml glass of fruit juice or smoothie – but do not have more than 1 portion a day as these drinks are sugary and can damage teeth
            Just 1 apple, banana, pear or similar-sized fruit is 1 portion each.

            A slice of pineapple or melon is also 1 portion, and 3 heaped tablespoons of vegetables is another portion.

            Adding a tablespoon of dried fruit, such as raisins, to your morning cereal is an easy way to get 1 portion.

            You could also swap your mid-morning biscuit for a banana, and add a side salad to your lunch. 

            In the evening, have a portion of vegetables with dinner and fresh fruit with plain, lower fat yoghurt for dessert to reach your 5 A Day.

        <h2 id="section3">Starchy foods in your diet</h2>
        <p>
            Starchy foods should make up just over a third of everything you eat. This means your meals should be based on these foods.

            Choose wholegrain or wholemeal varieties of starchy foods, such as brown rice, wholewheat pasta, and brown, wholemeal or higher fibre white bread.

            They contain more fibre, and usually more vitamins and minerals, than white varieties.

            Potatoes with the skins on are a great source of fibre and vitamins. For example, when having boiled potatoes or a jacket potato, eat the skin too.
